SplitStrike: Game Design Description

Game Overview

SplitStrike is a competitive, two-player mobile game played on a vertically split board. Each player competes to collect neutral pieces, gain control over them, and strategically flick them into the opponent’s end zone to score points. The game combines hidden information, reaction-time defense, and precision flicking to create a tense, skill-driven experience.

Core Concept

At its heart, SplitStrike is a battle of reflexes, strategy, and precision. Each player interacts only with their half of the board and only sees what is relevant to their side. Pieces become visible or invisible based on their position, introducing partial information and surprise-based tactics.


---

Game Setup

The board is vertically oriented (portrait mode).

It’s visually split down the center — top half belongs to Player 1, bottom half to Player 2.

The board has a polished wooden aesthetic, giving the feel of a classic tabletop game.

At the start, both players see a "Start" button centered on their side of the screen.



---

Start Phase

The game begins only when both players press their Start buttons.

Once both have pressed Start:

A predefined number of neutral pieces (5 or 7, configurable) appear at the center line of the board.

These pieces are equally accessible by both players and act as contested resources.




---

Claiming Phase

Players must quickly drag the central pieces into their own half to claim them.

As soon as a piece crosses fully into a player’s side, it is:

Assigned to that player.

Becomes invisible to the opponent.

Only visible to the owning player.


Once a piece is claimed, it cannot be reclaimed or intercepted by the opponent.



---

Main Gameplay (Flick Phase)

Claimed pieces are draggable with flick mechanics:

Players drag a piece backwards, like pulling a slingshot or cue stick.

An elastic tension feedback appears, indicating power.

Upon release, the piece is propelled forward based on drag length and angle.


The goal is to send pieces to the opponent’s board end and score.

Opponent Interaction & Hidden Elements

Fog-of-War Mechanic:

A player can only see:

Their own paddle.

Their claimed pieces.

Opponent’s pieces only after they cross the center line into their half.



Once a piece crosses the midline:

It becomes visible to the opponent.

It becomes invisible to the player who flicked it.




---

Defense Mechanic

Each player has a horizontal paddle/bar on their side:

It’s fixed in Y-position, moves only along the X-axis (left-right).

Only visible to the player who controls it.

Used to block or deflect incoming pieces.

Cannot intercept or interact with their own pieces.




---

Scoring Mechanic

At the end of each player’s board is a scoring tray:

Think of it like a collector pocket — similar to billiards pockets.

If an opponent’s piece passes through the tray boundary, it’s considered scored.


Once a piece enters the tray:

It is removed from play.

A visual indicator shows its entry (animation, counter, etc.).




---

Win Condition

The game continues until all pieces have been scored (i.e., entered either player's tray).

At the end:

The number of pieces in each player’s tray is compared.

The player with more opponent pieces in their tray is declared the winner.

If equal, the game ends in a draw.

Visual Design

Board Aesthetic

Smooth, polished wooden board, split by a slightly glowing center line.

The line is both visual and functional — it governs visibility logic.


Pieces

Disc-shaped tokens resembling coins or checkers.

Distinct color coding (e.g., red and blue), or optional neutral tone at spawn.

Smooth animation on drag and flick.

Subtle shine or outline for the active player’s claimed pieces.


Paddle Bar

Sleek, minimal horizontal bar.

Slightly raised to suggest it’s hovering or magnetic.

Animates lightly when moved to give tactile feedback.


Scoring Tray

Shaped like a semi-open slot at the far end of the board.

Animates with light effects or sounds when a piece enters.

Displays the number of pieces collected so far.


Drag/Flick Feedback

A stretchy arrow or arc line appears during drag.

The line grows with distance, showing strength.

On release, the line disappears, and the piece launches.



---

Game Feel & Feedback

Sound effects for:

Dragging a piece.

Flicking.

Bouncing off walls or paddles.

Scoring a piece.


Optional light haptic feedback when:

Paddle blocks a piece.

A piece is flicked.

A point is scored.

Summary

SplitStrike is a fast-paced, 1v1 mobile flicker game built around skillful movement, spatial awareness, and hidden information. The alternating visibility and one-sided paddle control make each move a mix of offense and defense. Simple to learn but difficult to master, the game emphasizes tactical timing, reactive defense, and precise shot control.
